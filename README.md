# pressure_transducer_routines
Process pressure transducer data

This well eventually serve as a repository for my pressure transducer scripts. 
I'll write a detailed description for each python routine and function. 
Also want to include samples of input .csv data files for the datetimes, pressures, well parameters, etc.
